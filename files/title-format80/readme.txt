This program generates titles for sections of code with a maximum of 80
characters per line to organize the algorithm. Just insert the title and then
the number of blanks that will be at the beginning of the line, here called
indentation. The result of the operation is copied to your clipboard, just paste
it into your IDE. As an example, there are two titles. The first is a title with
0 indentation, and the second with 3 indentation:

/********************************* MAIN CLASS *********************************/

   /******************************* CONSTRUCTORS ******************************/
